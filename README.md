The `word_pairs.R` file contain one function called `word_pairs()` to retrieve the occurrences of a pair of words in sentences. This is still under development and it is designed with sentence-based corpus of the Indonesian [Leipzig Corpora Collection](http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download) as the input. Further testing with different corpus-input is needed.
